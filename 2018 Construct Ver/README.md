## Why create such a Blog.
> Stay foolish, stay hungry.

Having a personal space to record life, learn more knowledge and connect with others is an amazing thing. It did. 



## About the name

I learned this name "Timegg" in *Doraemon* at the very beginning, which is the name of Doraemon's prop: "Time egg". At that time I was just a primary school student and was addicted to that  world. It brought me irreplaceable memories.  I still remember it today.
