## Why create such a Blog.
> Stay foolish, stay hungry.

I'm a student, but not major in CS. But it dose not matter I enjoy coding and doing something I like here. Having a personal space to record life, learn more knowledge and connect with others is an amazing thing.



## About the name

I learned this name "Timegg" in *Doraemon* at the very beginning, which is the name of Doraemon's prop: "Time egg". At that time I was just a primary school student and was addicted to Doraemon's  world. It brought me irreplaceable memories and I still remember those today.
