summary: "泛函分析和实变函数论都是数学系最核心的课程之一，同时也是之后要学到的拓扑学的基础。这些笔记可以帮助我快速复习回忆课程内容以及定理方程的使用，以针对考试。想要进一步的理解需要阅读原教案，内容量相对较多。"

*Functional Analysis Notes* is somewhat similar to *Topology.* Actually, topology can be seen as the deeper researching about various space. Functional analysis mainly focuses on these types of space: Metric space, Banach space, and Hilbert space.

The theories and methods are similar to ones in topology, so if you can master this course, you may perform excellently in topology.

Similar to topology, here are two notes, and one focuses on the definitions and another focuses on the theories in functional analysis. I believe these notes can help me remember them effectively and, actually, they work. So, just try to understand such theories and definitions and then remember them, practice them.
