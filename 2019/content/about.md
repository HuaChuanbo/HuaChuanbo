> Experience does for the soul, education does for the mind.



Hello, here is Chuanbo HUA.

 

I am now a first-year master's student in **KAIST**, majoring in **Industry and System Engineering**, interested in Graph Neural Network. 

I got my bachelor's degree in **Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)**, majoring in **Mathematics**, and exchanged at **Pohang Science and Technology University (POSTECH)**, majoring in **Computer Science**, working on Data Mining. 

I enjoy both mathematics and data science and have worked in **HIT Computer Network Technology Lab** and **HUAWEI Nanjing Research Center** (Algorithm Engineer Intern). 



I also enjoy traveling, photography, drawing, badminton, science fiction and music games. I tried everything I interested in with successes or failures; I planned my future with some confusion. And, everything here is a story.

 

This site was built in **2018**. The reason for building this site can not be recalled by me, but I can only remember that at that time I was curious about various things and keened on sharing everything with others, a book, a game, a story, a piece of music… I always believe other's evaluations equal my personal value at that time. So, this site is the result of excessive energy and thought.

 

But it does not matter I have insisted it three years, until today. During this time, there were massive things happened, happy or sad. The site was rebuilt four times, ~~from a small homepage in GitHub to a personal blog running in my personal ECS~~. And it will continuously grow and glow. Thanks for your companionship so far and to be continued.

Hi, 这里是 Chuanbo.

这一部分并不是上面内容的对照翻译，但依然是一段介绍。

本站创建于 2018 年春，与大多数个人网站创建的契机一样，受到其他人网站的启发，就做了自己的网站。

三年间，网站的发展走向不同于我的预料，它并没有成为一个技术博客，是因为之后的我觉得，与别人聊技术，远没有聊生活、聊想法来得有趣。

我不喜欢谈政治、谈社会。我喜欢文化和创意，各种没见过、没听过的东西，理想化的东西。

所以，在写东西之前，我会想什么东西只有我这里有，什么点子是没有人提到过的；不管写出来的东西有没有用，它有趣了没有。

这将是我网站在今后一段时间的更新标准，希望能让你觉得它在变得有趣。

那我们之后见。
